Easily add webcam, screen, and mic recordings to WordPress comments and forms with this shortcode-enabled plugin for video and audio submissions.

== Description ==

HTML5 Webcam Microphone Recorder Forms is a powerful, easy-to-use plugin that allows you to add video and audio recording capabilities directly into WordPress comment forms and custom forms. With this plugin, users can record from their webcam, screen, microphone and submit their recordings as part of their comment or form submission.

Key Features

* Seamless Form Integration: Adds a recording field to your forms with a simple shortcode. Users can easily record video or audio and submit it alongside their comments or form entries.
* Video Comments: Includes a button within the comments form for users to add video or audio recordings. This feature can be toggled on or off in the plugin settings. Submitted recordings are displayed as links that open in a new page or embed.
* Customizable Recorder: The recording interface appears in a user-friendly dialog box and allows multiple recordings. Recordings are uploaded to your server and can be automatically added to the Media Library or processed/published using the [Video Share VOD](https://videosharevod.com) plugin.
* Flexible Recording Options: Supports various recording types, including:
* * Webcam + Microphone Video
* * Screen + Microphone Video
* * Microphone-only Audio
* Simple Integration with Other Plugins: Perfect for use in more advanced setups like paid questions or message forms. Works well with the [PaidVideochat - Video Services Site](https://paidvideochat.com/) plugin.

Note: Recordings are saved in formats supported by the userâ€™s browser (e.g., MP4, WebM). Please be aware that some formats may not be compatible with all browsers.
